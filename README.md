## Neuroscientist, Computational Biologist, Next Generation Sequencing data analyst
## Personal Statement: 
My long-term research interests involve theworkings of the human brain, how the unique interplay of an individual's genetic blueprint and the dynamic landscape of epigenetic regulation shape diverse phenotypes and behavioral manifestations.My academic training and research experiences have provided me with an excellent background in multiple biological disciplines including microbiology, biochemistry, molecular biology, neuroscience, genetics, computational biology, bioinformatics, NGS data analysis, comparative genomics and evolutionary biology. During my doctoral study, we found an indication of potential role of protocadherin gamma (PCDHG) gene cluster in the evolution of human specific cognitive skill critical to reading, as the discovery of novel association of PCDHG genes with dyslexia came along. Currently in my post-doctoral research I am trying to understand the critical impact of the environmental exposure on brain development, functioning and behavioral outcome. In future I would like to see myself as an independent neuro scientist to drive innovative research, foster collaborations, and ultimately bring us closer to grow together and bring effective treatments for many devastating neurological disorders.
